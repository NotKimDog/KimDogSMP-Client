# Quick GitHub Setup - Visual Guide

## 🎯 I've Already Done Most of the Work!

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files committed (228 files)
✅ Branch set to 'main'
✅ Remote configured
✅ Helper scripts created
✅ GitHub creation page opened in browser

## ⚠️ YOU JUST NEED TO DO ONE THING:

### Create the repository on GitHub (takes 10 seconds!)

**The page is already open in your browser!**

On that page, fill in:

```
Repository name:    KimDogSMP-Client
Description:        KimDog SMP - Minecraft Fabric Mod
Visibility:         ● Public (or Private, your choice)

Initialize repository:
  [ ] Add a README file         ← LEAVE UNCHECKED
  [ ] Add .gitignore            ← LEAVE UNCHECKED
  [ ] Choose a license          ← LEAVE UNCHECKED

[Create repository] ← CLICK THIS BUTTON
```

## Then Choose ONE:

### 🖱️ Option A: Double-Click This File
```
push-to-github.bat
```
Location: Same folder as this file

### ⌨️ Option B: Run This Command
Open PowerShell in this folder and run:
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

### 💻 Option C: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Sign in
3. Add this folder as local repository
4. Click "Publish repository"

## ✅ Done!

After pushing, your repository will be live at:
https://github.com/NotKimDog/KimDogSMP-Client

## 🎮 Then Create Your First Release

1. Build: `.\gradlew.bat build`
2. Rename: `build\libs\kimdog-smp-1.0-DEV.jar` → `kimdog-smp-1.0.jar`
3. Go to: https://github.com/NotKimDog/KimDogSMP-Client/releases/new
4. Tag: `v1.0.0`
5. Upload the JAR file
6. Publish!

Your auto-updater will work immediately! 🚀
